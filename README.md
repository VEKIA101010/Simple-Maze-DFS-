# Simple-Maze-DFS-
# Maze DFS Demo â€” 50x50 Random Maze Solver (Depth-First Search)

This project generates a **random 50x50 maze** and solves it using the **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithm. The search process is animated in the terminal, showing how DFS explores the maze deeply before backtracking.

---

## Features

- **Random maze generation**: Each run produces a unique maze layout.
- **50x50 grid**: Large maze size to visualize DFS behavior clearly.
- **DFS pathfinding**: Explores one path as far as possible before backtracking.
- **Terminal animation**: Visualizes current path, stack top, and maze structure step-by-step.
- **Non-recursive implementation**: Uses an explicit stack, avoiding Python recursion limits.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Run the script:

```bash
